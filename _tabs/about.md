I'm Thinh Tran and this is my personal blog.

I've been working in the IT industry since 2011 through several small and medium-sized enterprises then later, changed to work with some startups as a freelancer. When being in enterprises, I used C#, Java, SQL Server, Oracle, and other enterprise tools. However, when starting working with startups, I chose to stick to Typescript, Nodejs, React & open-source tools. I felt in love with them since then. Currently, I'm working remotely at home, building software (backend, web apps, mobile apps) using Typescript, Nodejs, React, React Native, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

I love to solve life's problems by programming, reading books, and learning technologies. When having free time, my kids, Netflix and PS4 are my close friends.

This blog is where I take notes, write my ideas, my life experiences, and share them with other people.
