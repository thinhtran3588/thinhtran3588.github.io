It's been nearly 1.5 years since I started working remotely at home. Time flies and many things have changed so much. Luckily, my job isn't affected by Covid. I don't have to go to the company but stay all the time at home, choose the time I want to work (that's great!), have more time for my kids (that's great as well but sometimes a disaster T_T) and sometimes can take some side projects. The most important thing to me is that I can spend more time with my kids in their childhood, even those sometimes deadlines haunted me, and I couldn't play with them. But just staying nearby is still much better than working overtime day by day in the office. Besides that, after ten years working in companies, extending social networks isn't necessary to me anymore. So I would keep working remotely as long as I can.

I wrote some blogs with WordPress, Facebook notes, and Medium but couldn't keep the progress for a long time. But I still love writing: taking notes for what I want to use in the future, some tutorials which I can share with other developers, and some blogs about my life. So I looked for some tools and finally went with Jekyll and Github Pages. This time, it would be a project which lasts years, not just months.
