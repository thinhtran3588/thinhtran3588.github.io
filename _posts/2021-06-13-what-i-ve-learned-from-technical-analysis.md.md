I invested in Bitcoin a few years ago, but I have never taken it seriously. As a trivial result, I've lost almost all of my investment. It's just a small amount of money, and I have no problem losing it. However, when I started saving money for investment, I knew that I couldn't continue investing without any knowledge as before. I started studied little by little from posts on websites, Facebook, forums, and books. The most valuable resource to me so far is [Technical Analysis - The complete resource
for financial market technicians, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Complete-Financial-Technicians/dp/0137059442). Most of knowledge here comes from that book.

I write this post to note the most important Technical Analysis knowledge to me for future references and for anyone interested in it.

## Technical analysis

`Technical analysis` is used to determine the trend, when it is changing, when it has changed, when to enter a position (`buy low`), when to exit a position (`sell high`), and when the analysis is wrong and the position must be closed (`stop loss`).

## Assumptions

- Market has `trend` and it's `nonrandom`.
- `Price is determined by the interaction of supply and demand`. As basic economic theory teaches, when demand increases, price goes up, and when demand decreases, price goes down. One of the factors that determine supply and demand is buyer and seller expectations.
- The Averages discount everything. "`prices fully reflect all available information.`" (Eugene Fama’s,1970)
- `History, in principle, will repeat itself` (or as Mark Twain said, “History rhymes: It does not repeat”), and that humans will behave similarly to how they have in the past in similar circumstances.
- `Trend lines and patterns are fractal`. Each investor or trader has a specific time frame in which he or she operates. Interestingly, regardless of period, patterns occur with very similar, though not identical, shapes and characteristics

## Trend

There are 3 types of trend:

- A rising trend, or `uptrend`: occurs when prices reach higher peaks and higher troughs.
- A declining trend, or `downtrend`, is the opposite—when prices reach lower troughs and lower peaks.
- A `sideways` or flat trend occurs when prices trade in a range without significant underlying upward or downward movement.

## Markets

Markets are simply meeting places of buyers and sellers. Markets can be categorized in many ways. By dividing markets into categories based on how organized or integrated the market is, we have four different types of markets: direct search markets, brokered markets, dealer markets, and auction markets. We will only focus on the last one `auction markets`, where all participants converge at one place to buy or sell a good. The centralized facility can be a location, a clearinghouse, or even a computer. An important aspect of the auction market is that all information about offers and bids is centralized where it is readily accessible to all buyers and sellers. As all of the market participants converge, buyers and sellers need not search for each other, and a mutually agreeable price can be established, eliminating the bid-ask spread. The New York Stock Exchange is an example of a continuous auction market. Some auction markets can be studied using technical analysis, while others cannot.

### Exchange-traded fund (ETF)

A security replicates an index fund or a basket of assets has become extremely popular as a trading and a hedging vehicle. ETFs hold assets, similar to a mutual fund. In most cases, ETFs distribute dividends (or reinvest them), thus eliminating the dividend spread seen in the index futures and options markets.

### Derivative Markets

The term derivative describes a financial contract that “derives” its value from some other investment vehicle, often called the underlying. The primary use for derivatives is to hedge against risk of loss in the underlying or to speculate with high leverage

### Futures Markets

Futures contracts that are traded in the futures markets are contracts in which the buyer and seller agree to trade at specific terms at a specific future date. Futures, unlike stocks, are contracts and represent an agreement to purchase or sell a very specific amount and quality of asset at the expiration date.

### Option Markets

An option contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to complete the transaction stated in the contract before the expiration date of the contract. There are two basic types of options—call options and put options. The call option gives the owner the option to buy an asset at a particular price, known as the strike price, before the option expiration date. The owner of a put option has the right to sell the stated asset at the strike price before the option expiration date.

### Market players

There are 3 types of market players:

- `Informed players` (professional or smart money investors) are professional speculators, position traders, hedge fund managers, professional arbitrageurs, and insiders.
- `Uninformed (noise) players` are the uninformed market participants are the noise players. A more widespread and older term is the public. Most mutual fund managers, pension fund managers, traders, and technical analysts are considered also to be in this category, even if they are professionals.
- `Liquidity players` are market participants who affect prices in the markets for other reasons than investment or trading.

### How is the market measured?

As more of the market players want to buy stocks and fewer want to sell their stock holdings, stock prices will be driven up. Likewise, if many market players want to sell their stocks relative to the number of participants who want to buy stocks, stock prices will fall. Looking at the increase or decrease in the price of one stock will tell us how strong the market for that one particular stock is. If we want to measure the overall direction of the stock market, however, we need a way of measuring the movement of the broad market that is composed of the stocks of many companies: Price-Weighted Average, Market Capitalization Weighted Average, Equally Weighted (or Geometric) Average.

## Dow theory

`Charles Dow`, the father of modern technical analysis, was the first to create an index that measures the overall price movement of U.S. stocks. However, he never specifically formulated what has become known as the “Dow Theory.” Indeed, he likely never intended his disjointed statements and observations in the Wall Street Journal to become formalized.

Three hypotheses are presented by Robert Rhea, who wrote a book called _The Dow Theory: An Explanation of Its Development and an Attempt to Define Its Usefulness as an Aid to Speculation_ in 1932:

1. While the secondary and the minor, day-to-day motion of the stock market averages could possibly be manipulated, the primary trend is inviolate.
2. The averages discount everything.
3. Dow Theory is not infallible.

### Dow theory theorem

- The ideal market picture consists of an uptrend, top, downtrend, and bottom, interspersed with retracements and consolidations.
- Economic rationale should be used to explain stock market action.
- Prices trend. A trend is defined as the general direction in which something tends to move.

There are three basic trends in price motion, each defined by time:

1. `The Primary Trend`: the longest of the three trend types. It represents the overall, broad, long-term movement of security prices. The duration of this long-term trend can be several years. The primary trend may be an upward trend, which is known as a primary bull trend, or it may be a downward trend, referred to as a primary “bear” trend.

   - `Primary bull markets` are characterized by three separate phases: The first represents reviving confidence from the prior primary bear market; the second phase represents the response to increased corporate earnings; and the third is when speculation becomes dominant and prices rise on “hopes and expectations.”

   - `Primary bear markets` are long downward price movements, interrupted by occasional rallies, that continue until prices have discounted the worst that is apt to occur. They, too, are characterized by three separate phases: first, abandonment of hopes upon which stocks were purchased; second, selling due to decreased earnings; and third, distress selling, regardless of value, by those who believe the worst is yet to come or who are forced to liquidate.

2. `The Secondary Trend`: an intermediate-term trend that runs counter to the primary trend. For example, during a several-year primary uptrend, prices may fall for a few weeks or a few months. During this secondary trend market decline, prices fall often, erasing 33% to 66% of the gain that has occurred since the completion of the previous secondary uptrend. Being able to anticipate or recognize secondary reactions increases profit capabilities by taking advantage of smaller market swings, but Dow believed this exercise was too dangerous. Because the primary trend and secondary trend reversal have similar characteristics, secondary reactions are often initially assumed as changes in primary trends or are mistakenly thought to be only reactions when the primary trend is changing.

3. `The Minor Trend`: Daily fluctuations correspond to chaotic daily market movements which may last from a couple of hours to several days. These fluctuations are chaotic and thus they are unpredictable.

### Confirmation

The Dow Theory aims to signal changes in the primary market direction, and in order to achieve that mission, it uses two popular stock-market averages, DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial) and DJTA (Dow Jones Transportation).

- If one of these two indices changes its master trend, then this movement is evaluated as a secondary trend.

- If both indices change their master trend, then the master trend of the market is considered as changed.

Obviously, we need to use other averages. There are many methods that can be used in order to distinguish a Bull from a Bear market. For example, many analysts use the 200-day Moving Average. If the market is above its 200-day MA then it is considered bullish, and if it trades below its 200-day MA it is considered bearish. Numerous other methods can be applied.

### Importance of Volume

Although volume of transactions cannot signal a trend reversal, it is important as a secondary confirmation of trend. Excessively high market prices that are accompanied by less volume on rallies and more activity on declines usually suggest an overbought market. Conversely, extremely low prices with dull declines and increased volume on rallies suggest an oversold market. “Bull markets terminate in a period of excessive activity and begin with comparatively light transactions” (Rhea, 1932). The originators of Dow Theory were quick, however, not to overstate the importance of volume. Although volume was considered, it was not a primary consideration. Price trend and confirmation overrode any consideration of volume.
